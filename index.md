# Drone-Phenome Project

This is a directory for web applications related to high-throughput phenotyping using drones. Drone images are stored and viewable using Imagebreed. Data analysis can be done using CropGalaxy tools and machine learning for phenotype predictions using drone indices are also available. Training materials, SOPs and drone-related resources are also made available.

## **Training Course**<br>

The Bioinformatics Team under the KOICA-UPLB-IRRI project designed **Basic Digital Phenotyping Course** which includes modules on High-Throughput Phenotyping using drones and ImageBreed. <br>

For more information on the course, visit Basic Digital Phenotyping on [openlearning.cgiar.org]. The course was conducted last September 19 - November 22, 2024.<br>

For future training opportunities, please visit the [IRRI Education] website.<br>
